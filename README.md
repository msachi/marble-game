## Marble game

This is a simple game that I made as an exercise in learning the `deviceorientation` API.

Goal: you need to get the marble (top) into the hole (bottom).
Marbles change colours as you move your phone around.
If you get your marble into the hole, something magical will happen!

This game was optimized for iPhone 5S.
